What do you call a turkey in Turkey?  An india!  So what do you call an india in
India?  A peru!  English isn't the only language that likes to name its birds
after countries.

Before you ask what you call a peru in Peru, just look at the chart:

{% include image.html name="turkey_chart.jpg" caption="The name for turkey in many different languages." link=1 %}

It turns out most languages name this bird after a foreign country.  And when
you trace the names from country to country, you almost always end up in Peru.

## Is that right?

Well... no, the diagram above is not quite correct.  The most important links in
the diagram are over-simplified.  In particular:

**Turkish was not the only widespread language in Turkey when turkeys came to
Europe.** Three languages were widespread in Turkey at the time: Turkish,
Mesopotamian Arabic, and Kurmanji Kurdish.  Turkish has two words for "turkey":
one refers to India, and the other is *culuk*, from an Ottoman word for
"woodcock".  Mesopotamian Arabic and Kurmanji Kurdish both have onomatopoeia
names: *alu alu* and *elok*, respectively.  So while some people from Turkey
would eventually call a turkey an "india", not everybody would.

**India has many languages.** If we exclude Malayalam (see below), many of the
most widespread Indian languages call the turkey a "peru".  However, some of
them also call it a turkey.  And some do not refer to a place at all.

**The dominant language in Calicut (now Kozhikode) is Malayalam, not Hindi.**
Many of the references to India are actually references to the city of Kozhikode
(formerly known as Calicut) where Malayalam is the dominant language.  Malayalam
has different words for turkey than most Indian languages.  Three words are in
common use: *vaan kozhi* (literally "mouth chicken"), *thurki kozhi* (literally
"Turkey chicken") or *kalkkam*, which comes from the Dutch word, meaning
"Calicut".  So, in Kozhikode, they don't actually call the bird a peru.  They
call it a mouth chicken, a turkey, or... a kozhikode.

**Historically, "India" could have also meant the West Indies.** The languages
of the pre-Columbian West Indies primarily derived from the Arawakan language
family.  The most widely spoken of these languages was Taíno.  Since it
continued to be spoken for many years after colonization, we know the word for
turkey was _guanaho_.  (Modern Cuban Spanish still uses the word *guanajo*,
based on the Taíno word.)  The proto-Arawakan root for the word "turkey" is
thought to be
[*mara-dii](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Arawakan_reconstructions),
which would have been either modified or replaced in the various Arawakan
languages.

**Spanish has many words for turkey.** Today, the dominant language in Peru is
Spanish, but Spanish has many different words for turkey.  The Castilian
Spanish word *pavo* comes from the Latin for peacock, but other names include
*chompipe*, *chumpe*, *gallina de la tierra*, *gánso*, _guanajo_, _guajolote_, _kókono_, 
_picho_, _pisco_, and _pípila_.

**Historically, "Peru" referred to the regions of South America colonized by the
Spanish.**  The area called "Peru" roughly coincided with the Inca Empire, but
did not include Mexico, which fell within New Spain.  Turkeys were domesticated
throughout the Americas long before the arrival of the Spanish.  Therefore,
instead of Spanish, we need to look at the languages of pre-colonial Peru.
While most of these languages are now extinct, two such languages are still
spoken today: Quechua and Aymara.  The Quechua word for turkey is *qallqatu*,
but it is unclear if this is a modern loan word referring to Kozhikode.  The
Aymara word for turkey is *pawu*, and again, it is unknown whether this word
existed in pre-Columbian times, whether it derived from the modern Spanish word
*pavo*, or whether it refers to "Peru", another self-reference.  Since turkeys
are not native to Peru, the name for turkey may not have even been standardised
in these regions.

So, using all of this information, we can construct a more accurate chart.

{% include image.html name="turkey_chart_accurate.jpg" caption="The more accurate name for turkey in many different languages." link=1 %}

This time, the flow through languages can go in loops and circles, and there is
no single country at the end.

## So where are turkeys actually from?

Turkeys are not native to Peru.  In fact, they are not native to *any* of the
lands they are named after.  Turkeys are native to North and Central America.
By 700 AD, wild turkeys (*Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo*) were domesticated in
Southern Mexico, and by 1500, this domesticated breed of turkey was widespread
throughout Mexico, Central America, and parts of northern South America.  This
is the domesticated breed that the Spanish brought back to Europe in 1511.

Turkeys grew to be very popular in Europe and were widespread by the 1550s.
They were so popular that the English colonists brought turkeys with them to New
England in the early 1600s.  These domesticated turkeys interbred with the much
larger wild turkeys in eastern North America (*Meleagris gallopavo
silvestris*). The hybrid turkey, now known as the [American
Bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_turkey), was then exported from the
Americas back to Europe, and from Europe around the world.  The hybrid turkeys
became even more popular than the original domesticated Mexican turkeys, and are
the same turkeys we enjoy today.


### Appendix: Turkey naming trivia

In Farsi, one word for turkey is *bughalamun*, the same as the word for
"chameleon".  This word used to be the name of a colourful fabric (a
[damask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damask)).  Like chameleons, male turkeys
can change the colour of the skin on their head to red, blue, or white.  [This
is due to the arrangement of collagen and blood vessels in their
skin](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/mrs.2014.64).

In Farsi, another word for turkey translates to "elephant bird", a translation
shared with Burmese and Thai.  Male turkeys have a
"[snood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)#Anatomy)", a long, narrow,
dangly flap of skin which hangs over the top of their beak.  If you squint, this
might resemble an elephant's trunk.  This snood can also contract to form a
small horn, resembling a unicorn.  All of these colours and shapes on its face
earned it the name "seven faced bird" in Japanese and Korean.

In Greek, the translation is literally "French bird", but the origin of the term
"French" is unrelated to France.  The Greek name for turkey is *galopoula*.  The
suffix *poula* is a feminine suffix (and *pouli* can also mean bird), but *galo*
originates from romance languages, meaning cockerel.  It is probably a
[shortened loan word from old romance languages, *galo
d'India*]([https://el.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B3%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BB%CE%B1).
But in Greek, *galo* can also mean "French".  So, the Greek the reference to
France is just a coincidence, and may truly be a reference to India.

Likewise, in Pennsylvania German, reference to Wales is a coincidence.  The
literal translation of *Welschhinkel* is "foreign chicken", not "Welsh chicken".
In Pennsylvania German, *Welsch* does not mean Wales, it simply means "foreign".
By coincidence, the word for "foreign" bears an uncanny resemblance to the name
of a country, even though the etymologies are different.

Finally, the best false etymology of all: in Malayalam, Kozhikode translates to
"chicken castle" (from *kozhi* and *kota*)!


### Appendix: Words for turkey

The following is a list of different translations of the word "turkey".  I have
left out any words which are named after India, Kozhikode, Turkey, and Peru.
Some of the languages below may have a second word named after one of these four
places, which do not appear in the table, even if those names are more popular
than the listed names.

I have confirmed each of these words through multiple sources.  When a source is
not obvious, I have linked to it.

[^kurd]: Kurmanji Kurdish Wikipedia claims a few more country names, including
    Misri (Egyptian, çûkê Misirê) and Shami (Demascus/Syria, çûkê Şamê), but I
    cannot seem to verify these names.

[^yuc]: I have included the Yucatec Mayan word "kutz", even though this word
    refers specifically to the ocellated turkey, a different (but closely
    related) species found only on the Yucatan peninsula.


[^bre]: In Breton, the bird's name is widely cited to be *yar-Spagn* ("Spanish
    chicken"), but this word appears to be rare.  The much more common name is
    *yar-Indez* ("Indian chicken").
